This is a generalized collection of tools and notes. Notable entries:

* [Rnotes.md](Rnotes.md) - Very large, monolithic notes on the R
  statistical language, generated as I learn it (related to my
  [Coursera repository][coursera]).
  * [GotchasInR.md](GotchasInR.md) - As I find unexpected or
    counterintuitive (to me, at least) R behaviors I record them here.
* [GitNotes.md](GitNotes.md) - Notes on using Git and GitHub
